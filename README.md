# Machine Learning in Recruiting - Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to build a conversational AI model that answers questions based on information from PDF documents. The chatbot can be used for answering queries related to the context of machine learning in recruiting.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `langchain`
- `bitsandbytes`
- `tiktoken`
- `openai`
- `PyPDF2`
- `faiss-cpu`

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
!pip install -q transformers accelerate langchain bitsandbytes
!pip install tiktoken openai PyPDF2 faiss-cpu
```

## Loading and Configuring the Model

### Import Necessary Libraries
First, we import the necessary libraries:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader
from langchain.vectorstores import ElasticVectorSearch, Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
import os
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import HuggingFacePipeline
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

### Load the Model from HuggingFace

We will load the Falcon-7B model from HuggingFace.

```python
model = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    device=0  # Use CUDA (GPU) if available
)
```

### Set the Device and Model Parameters

Next, we set the device to GPU if available and specify model parameters.

```python
device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
torch_device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

## Loading and Preprocessing the PDF Document

### Load the PDF

We load the PDF document from which the chatbot will extract information.

```python
pdf_path = 'path/to/your/pdf.pdf'
reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)

text = ''
for page_num in range(len(reader.pages)):
    page = reader.pages[page_num]
    text += page.extract_text()
```

### Split the Text

We split the text into smaller chunks to facilitate easier processing:

```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=0,
)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(text)
```

## Creating the Vector Store

We use `OpenAIEmbeddings` to convert the text chunks into embeddings and create a vector store.

```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(texts, embeddings)
```

## Setting Up the Conversational Chain

### Set Up the Memory

We configure the conversation memory to store the interaction history.

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
```

### Create the Conversational Retrieval Chain

Now, we set up the Conversational Retrieval Chain, which uses the vector store for retrieving relevant chunks based on user queries.

```python
qa_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), 
    vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory
)
```

## Running the Chatbot

We can now start interacting with the chatbot, where the user input will be processed and answered based on the PDF content.

### Chatbot Interaction

```python
while True:
    query = input("Ask a question: ")
    if query.lower() == 'exit':
        break

    result = qa_chain({"question": query})
    print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
```

### Handling Multiple Questions

To handle multiple questions, you can set up a loop that continuously takes user input, queries the model, and prints the answer until the user decides to exit.

```python
# Example: Asking questions in a loop
while True:
    question = input("Ask a question (type 'exit' to quit): ")
    if question.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    answer = qa_chain.run(question)
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

## Conclusion

This project leverages machine learning to build an intelligent chatbot capable of answering questions based on a large body of text extracted from PDF files. It uses HuggingFace models, Langchain's retrieval and memory capabilities, and OpenAI embeddings to facilitate sophisticated question-answering capabilities.

Feel free to extend the project by adding more complex models, improving PDF processing, or integrating the chatbot into a web application.
